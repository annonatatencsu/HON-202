America isn't the only country welcoming immigrants and giving people a new home to live and thrive in.  "

Most notably, I found the birds to be reminiscent of the mindless, pack scavenger nature of pigeons. Other aspects of the setting definitely aren't reminiscent of NYC though, so it would be interesting to explore how the city was developed visually. ",
